# Gmail-App 

This is a python stand-alone application which interacts with the gmail-client-api and handles the emails based on different filters

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
```
Python version - Python 3.8.2
Database - MySQL 
```

### Installing

The application uses Gmail's native API to interact with the emails. 


```
To successfully connect with the google servers please create a api configuration and update the gmail_credentials.json file.
That file would require for the Client Id, Client Secret and the Project Id. 

You can also replace this file with the credentials.json file downloaded form google API. It requires that the file should be renamed to gmail_credentials.json ```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
